# WiDS Datathon Project


## Description

Neuropsychiatric disorders that occur in development, like anxiety,
depression, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or
ADHD, often differ in how and to what extent they affect males and
females. ADHD occurs in about 11% of adolescents, with around 14% of
boys and 8% of girls having a diagnosis. There is some evidence that
girls with ADHD can often go undiagnosed, as they tend to have more
inattentive symptoms which are harder to detect. Girls with ADHD who are
undiagnosed with continue suffering from symptoms that burden their
mental health and capacity to function.

Fundamental Question: What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and if so, how?

## Notes:
- build a multi-outcome model to predict both an individual's sex and ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging data of adolescents and their socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information
- a multi-outcome model is designed to predict multiple target variables simultaneously using a single machine learning model
